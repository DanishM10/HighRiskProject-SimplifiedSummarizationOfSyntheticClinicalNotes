Patient diagnosed with \\\"Received higher education (finding)\\\" - This part of the note seems to indicate that the patient has a higher level of education. This finding may be relevant to the patient's overall health and management.\\n\\n2. Observation shows Glucose [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma at 66.9 mg/dL - This indicates the patient's blood glucose level is 66.9 mg/dL. A normal fasting blood glucose level is typically between 70-99 mg/dL, so this value is slightly lower than normal.\\n\\n3. Started treatment with insulin isophane human 70 UNT/ML / insulin regular human 30 UNT/ML Injectable Suspension [Humulin] - This part of the note indicates that the patient has been started on a combination of insulin isophane human (70 UNT/ML) and insulin regular human (30 UNT/ML) injectable suspension. This combination of insulins is commonly used to manage diabetes, particularly to control blood sugar levels.\\n\\nIn summary, the clinical note suggests that the patient with a higher education level has a lower than normal blood glucose level of 66.9 mg/dL and has been started on a specific insulin regimen to help manage their condition, likely diabetes.\",\n          \"Let's break down the clinical note step by step:\\n\\n1. **Diagnosis**: The patient has been diagnosed with \\\"Housing unsatisfactory (finding).\\\" This likely indicates that the patient's living conditions are not adequate or suitable for their health and well-being.\\n\\n2. **Observation**: The observation shows that the Hemoglobin A1c/Hemoglobin total in the blood is at 6.0%. Hemoglobin A1c is a marker used to monitor blood sugar levels over time, with 6.0% indicating good blood sugar control for most people.\\n\\n3. **Treatment**: The patient has been started on Naproxen sodium 220 MG Oral Tablet. Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used to relieve pain, inflammation, and swelling.\\n\\nIn summary, the clinical note suggests that the patient's living conditions are not satisfactory, their blood sugar control is good, and they have been prescribed Naproxen for treatment, likely for pain relief or inflammation.\",\n          \"Let's break down the clinical note step by step:\\n\\n1. Diagnosis: The patient has been diagnosed with \\\"Risk activity involvement (finding).\\\" This term typically refers to a patient's increased risk of a particular health issue due to their involvement in certain activities or behaviors. Further information may be needed to understand the specific risk involved.\\n\\n2. Observation: The note mentions an observation of FEV1/FVC at 48.9%. FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second) and FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) are lung function tests used to assess respiratory health. A ratio of FEV1/FVC below 70% is often indicative of obstructive lung disease, such as asthma or COPD.\\n\\n3. Treatment: The patient has been started on Clopidogrel 75 MG Oral Tablet. Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet medication commonly used to prevent blood clots in patients at risk for heart attacks or strokes. The dosage mentioned is 75 mg, which is a standard starting dose for this medication.\\n\\nIn summary, the clinical note indicates that the patient has an increased risk related to certain activities, has abnormal lung function test results, and has been prescribed Clopidogrel for treatment. Further evaluation and management may be needed based on the specific details of the patient's condition.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Tree-of-Thought Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1.

The patient with a higher education background has a glucose level of 66.9 mg/dL and has started treatment with a specific insulin regimen.\\n   c. The patient, who has a higher education level, is managing their low blood sugar with a prescribed insulin combination.\\n\\n2. Possible Summaries:\\n   a. The patient with higher education is being treated for low blood sugar using a combination of insulin types.\\n   b. The patient's glucose level is 66.9 mg/dL, and they have initiated treatment with insulin isophane and regular insulin.\\n   c. Patient, with higher education, is managing low blood sugar with a specific insulin regimen.\\n\\n3. Best Summary for Patient Understanding:\\n   \\\"You have started treatment for your low blood sugar by using a combination of insulin types, insulin isophane, and regular insulin. This is to help manage your glucose level, which is currently at 66.9 mg/dL. It's important to continue following your prescribed insulin regimen to keep your blood sugar levels stable.\\\"\",\n          \"1. Possible interpretations:\\n   a. The patient has been diagnosed with unsatisfactory housing conditions, which may be impacting their health.\\n   b. The patient has a Hemoglobin A1c level of 6.0%, indicating good blood sugar control.\\n   c. The patient has been prescribed Naproxen sodium 220 MG Oral Tablet for a specific condition.\\n\\n2. Possible summaries:\\n   a. The patient's living situation is not ideal and may be affecting their health.\\n   b. The patient's blood sugar control is good with a Hemoglobin A1c level of 6.0%.\\n   c. The patient has been given Naproxen sodium 220 MG Oral Tablet for treatment.\\n\\n3. The best summary for patient understanding would depend on the context and the patient's current concerns. If the patient is more focused on their housing situation, summarizing the unsatisfactory housing condition may be most relevant. However, if the patient is more interested in their health status, summarizing the good blood sugar control may be more appropriate. Ultimately, the best summary should address the patient's main concerns and help them understand the key points of the clinical note.\",\n          \"1. Possible interpretations of the note:\\n   a.
